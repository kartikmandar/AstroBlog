            <h2>Medieval Finitism</h2>
            <p>"<i>As far as I remember Aristotle, you promised to discuss the possibility of our universe being finite?
                </i>", inquires T.</p>
            <p>"<i>Nah, T; I already explained in the book about the infinitism of the universe.</i>", asserted
                Aristotle.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <li>The medieval primordial infinitism model(i.e. our universe is infinitely large) remained prevalent
                    for a long time. Such was the belief among the Greeks upon Aristotle that they refused to accept any
                    other model for a very long time.
                </li>
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>Treatise De Luce(On Light)</h2>
            <p>T:- <i>Hi Robert. I heard a lot about your treatise De Luce. Do shine a light on it?</i></p>
            <p>Robert:- <i>Thanks T. Basically what I wanted to convey is that the universe doesn't need to have
                    infinite age! We can assume that the universe came into being from an explosion. Then it could be
                    further inferred that all the stars and planets formed when the matter crystallizes(cooled down) in
                    a set of nested spheres around Earth.</i></p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <li>Robert Grosseteste was the first person to attempt to describe the heavens using a single set of
                    physical laws.</li>
            </p>
            <p>Then for nearly 4 centuries, the realm of cosmology was in eerie silence without any fresh discoveries.

                    <p>Give this picture a quick look. Wait before you stare at the photo, do you know what a line of
                        sight is?</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Take a straight long line emerging from your eyes( say for strictly experimental purposes; you
                        can assume yourself to be akin to superman). Now wherever that line(or laser) falls, that object
                        is said to be in your line of sight(dunno why the screen hasn't yet melted!).</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Back to the picture; wherever you could see, your line of sight will eventually meet a tree's

                <li>To all the people, who love to nitpick, saying that they could see a pixel or two which doesn't look
                    like trees(probably the sky or mountain behind); I would love to argue with them in the comments!
                </li>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>But everyone can agree with me on one thing:- the sky is dark at night. Right? Trivial but this very fact
                was used by Johannes Kepler in 1610 to conclude a striking observation.</p>
            <br>
            <p>T:- <i>Johannes; isn't it so serene? The night sky brimming with stars on a new moon. I am in complete
                    awe!</i></p>
            <p>Kepler:- <i>True T. What amazes me is that this infinite universe has unlimited stars and yet we can only
                    behold the beauty of a few thousand! Wait, T, if there are infinite stars why can't we see all of
                    them?</i></p>
            <p>T:- <i>Probably they are too far away.</i></p>
            <p>Kepler:- <i>Yes they are indeed far. But as we assume our universe to be static, infinite, and
                    homogeneous; the distance would not matter as far as brightness is concerned.</i></p>
            <p>T:- <i>Hmm...I doubt if this fact is valid. I would barely see a candle from a mile away but I can very
                    well notice it if it's right next to me.</i></p>
            <p>Kepler:- <i>:) Haha.. let me explain...Let's consider concentric spherical shells(i.e. one beach ball
                    inside another & so on). For a second assume it to be our boundless universe.</i></p>
            <br>
            <p><i>The surface area of each concentric shell (balls) will increase four times if the radius is doubled.
                    Assuming each outer shell to be twice the inner one and the universe to be homogeneous, we could
                    conclude that the outer shell will have 4 times the number of stars. But as these stars are twice as
                    far away they would have 1/4th the brightness.</i></p>
            <p><i>One can see the net effect neatly comes out to be the same.</i></p><br>
            <p>1star=1nits <i>(only for explanation purposes)</i></p>
            <br>
            <p><i><u>Inner Shell</u>
                </i></p>
            <p><i>No. of stars = 1</i></p>
            <p><i>Distance = same = r
                </i></p>
            <p><i>Brightness = No. of stars * Reciprocal of distance squared = 1 * 1 / r² = 1 / r²</i></p>
            <p><i><u>Outer Shell</u></i></p>
            <p><i>No. of stars = 4</i></p>
            <p><i>Distance = twice = 2r
                </i></p>
            <p><i>Brightness = No. of stars* Reciprocal of distance squared = 4 * 1 / 4r² = 1 / r²</i></p>
            <br>
            <p><i>We can see their brightness turns out to be equal. This means that all the shells(balls) will portray
                    the same overall brightness.
                </i></p>
            <p><i>Now as the universe is infinite it must have infinite shells and stars. </i></p>
            <p><i>Thus no matter where we look our line of sight must meet at the surface of a star(even though it can
                    be very far).
                </i></p>
            <p><i>And as we just showed the overall brightness of the shell will always remain the same.</i></p>
            <br>
            <p>So shouldn't the whole sky just light up like day?
            </p>
            <li>This idea didn't become widespread until the 19th century when Heinrich Olbers developed it further and
                this came to be knowns as Olbers Paradox.
            </li>
            <li>The modern explanation of this paradox is that some stars are so far away from us that the light they
                emit has not still reached us. So rather than proving the universe is finite in space the paradox
                concluded it must be finite in age!

                    galaxy. It is twice as big as ours.

            <img src="/img/andromeda.jpeg" alt="Andromeda Galaxy" class="andromeda">
            <p>T:-<i> Yes, yes I read your article in 1923. But how does it concern us; galaxy or nebulae, it's still
                    outta our reach!
                </i></p>
            <p>Hubble:-<i> To be honest it does matter, go back 5 years and nobody would believe in the existence of
                    outer space. It's really important to know that the cosmos is much much more than just our barred
                    spiral. For our theories of cosmos to explain the observations satisfactorily we want a homogeneous
                    universe.
                </i></p>
            <p><i>Let's count the number of galaxies above a minimum brightness in some defined area of the sky. This
                    number that we counted should turn out to be the same for other parts of the sky with the same area!
                </i></p>
            <p>T:-<i> That's cool!
                </i></p>
            <li>This fact is indeed true but only holds for galaxies that are in our local neighbourhood, for much
                farther objects the observations deviate from this rule.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Hubble's Law</h2>
            <p><i>"You must have heard the siren of an ambulance? If I ask you to close your eyes and tell whether it's
                    coming towards you or moving away, will you be able to answer correctly?</i></p>
            <p><i>For most, the answer would be an easy yes. How is it that we are so inherently adapted to distinguish
                    the nuances of sounds? We should thank our ability to the positioning of our ears and the brain's
                    ability to analyze the phase difference in sounds coming from each ear. </i></p>
            <p><i>But this is not what concerns us.</i></p>
            <p><i>The very fact that we can distinguish is because of the Doppler Effect.</i></p>
            <p>Take up a rubber band and fix one of its ends. Now move the rubber band towards or away from
                yourself(don't break it). It gets stretched!</p>
            <p>Similarly, the sound waves also do get stretched however the effect is different for different
                directions, unlike rubber bands!
            </p>
            <p>So we perceive those sounds differently. The frequency( shrillness) increases if the sound emitter is
                coming toward us while it decreases in the latter case.
            </p><br>
            <p>You can just ditto this fact in the case of light waves. Here rather than saying frequency increases or
                decreases we use the terms blue and redshift respectively.
            </p>
            <p>Galaxies moving towards us are blue-shifted.
            </p>
            <p>While those moving away are red-shifted. "

            <p>*clapping noises*
            </p>
            <p>T:-<i> Wonderful Edwin but what's the significance of this?
                </i></p>
            <p>Hubble:-<i> T, you sure jump to conclusions prematurely! :)
                </i></p>
            <p>In 1920 I found out that the amount of redshift in galaxies was dependent on their distance from us. If
                their redshift is from the Doppler effect then this suggests that galaxies move away from each other at
                speeds proportional to their distance, i.e. the universe is expanding as a whole!
            </p>
            <p><i>Now let's reverse engineer the process. If the universe is expanding, shouldn't it be smaller than in
                    the past! Then if we extrapolate enough there must exist a time when all of the observable universe
                    must be so small that it all should have been a point.
                </i></p>
            <p><i>Recent calculations do support this belief.
                </i></p>
            <p>Ignoring the mathematics behind we could say if H is Hubble's law constant then 1/H or H^-1 would be
                approximately the age of the universe.
            </p>

            <h2>Background Radiation
            </h2>
            <p><i>"Voila, voila T it's there", Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson exclaimed together.
                </i></p>
            <p>T:-<i> What's there?
                </i></p>
            <p>Both:-<i> The universal microwave background radiation; George Gamow was right!
                </i></p>
            <p>
                <li>You would have felt the shockwave of big fireworks or even a big tire bursting near you!
                </li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>In 1940 George Gamow told if the universe came in with a bang; there must be a shockwave present!
                    The cosmic microwave background radiation is that same shockwave discovered by Robert and Arno in
                    1979.
                </li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>To be honest, this is not exactly true, the radiation was a byproduct of inflation but as all of
                    this text is oversimplified pardon me for the partial truth!
                </li>
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Isotropy of Universe
            </h2>
            <p>Apart from cosmic microwave background radiation, the even distribution of radio waves, X-rays, faint
                galaxies, and Hubble's Law all point to the fact that our universe is isotropic(similar properties
                everywhere) and homogeneous.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Age of Universe
            </h2>
            <p>The age of the universe calculated from Hubble's Law comes out to be between 10-15 billion years. Quite
                surprisingly the oldest stars and clusters in our galaxy are also 10-15 billion years old.
            </p>
            <p>This is strong evidence that Hubble's law is due to expansion and the oldest stars formed in the very
                early days of the universe.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Helium Abundance
            </h2>
            <p>Some theories also provide an acceptable amount of abundance of elements. Observation shows the oldest
                objects contain about 25% Helium(the rest is mostly hydrogen). And the computations from theories yield
                Helium abundance of the same quantity.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Cosmological Principle
            </h2>
            <p>There is an unspoken confirmation among astronomers. Although a far-reaching assumption, they believe in
                the cosmological principle. It states that the properties and behavior of objects become regular after
                we zoom out a lot,i.e., looking at the universe as a whole.
            </p>
            <p>Though the cosmological principle does put useful constraints on the large variety of possible
                cosmological theories it doesn't come into play if we are considering less than a few thousand galaxies!
            </p>
            <p>This principle is closely related to homogeneity and isotropy of the universe but not exactly synonymous.
                Like the Copernican principle, it concludes that our position in the universe is in no way special.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Mr. T
            </h2>
            <p><i>In this quest of understanding history we came across many great pioneers and scientists but who was
                    that Mr. T guy! And ow in this world was he alive all this time.
                </i></p>
            <p>Mr. T is none other than the pursuit of truth that every person, not just a scientist must follow. It's
                the basis of our creativity, the essence of the scientific process.
            </p>
            <p>You must ask yourself questions again and again till you get nearest to the answers and accept it as a
                satisfactory result till some new problem arises. After that just rinse and repeat.
            </p><br>
            <p>The pursuit of truth in science is very similar to a potter carving his pot. You have it refine it again
                and again. But at some point you gotta ask; is it good enough for me? If that answer is not a loud 'no'
                then my dear friend you have got it right.
            </p>
            <p>Say the potter keeps refining it; wouldn't he grind it so much that the very foundation of that pot will
                turn brittle. Similarly, theories are to be abandoned if the scars run down deeper than the pot can
                handle!
            </p><br>
            <p>On the other hand, some blemishes can be pure, you gotta keep them! Keep polishing yourself but remember
                the same toothbrush that cleans your teeth can erode the enamel away if you use it harder!
            </p><br>
            <p>Let's not digress more as now is the time for speed and explosiveness!
            </p><br><br>
            <h2>Big bang(tbh it feels that they purposely used the most generic name possible)
            </h2>
            <p>At the earliest times, the temperatures and pressure were so immense that all the theories to explain the
                process just fails.
            </p><br>
            <p>The universe at that time was hot and dense but peaceful. There was nothing to disturb it! Neither time
                nor space was created just then.
            </p>
            <p>It was like a child in a mother's womb, full of life but peaceful.
            </p><br>
            <p>Then something happened, something quite extraordinary that we can't comprehend or explain to date. The
                peaceful universe lost its equilibrium. This was the very birth of time and space as we know it.
            </p>
            <p>Who did that, and how did it happen? No one knows. Some say it's God, others claim we are just some
                experiment. I will say we don't know just yet.
            </p><br>
            <p>If the universe would have been perfectly balanced( as all things should be ~T) we would not have been
                here. There was some defect in this symmetry.
            </p><br>
            <p>Believe me, if I say all matter has its antimatter counterpart and if they meet, they annihilate each
                other, releasing energy (equivalent to their masses E=mc^2) in the process.
            </p><br>
            <p>For some reason (defective symmetry) the matter particles were more than the anti-matter particles by
                1.000000001%. If they would have been the same in number, they would have quickly annihilated
                themselves, and that my dear friend would have been the end of the story.
            </p>
            <p>However, that was not the case; as a result, 0.000000001% of matter particles lived on to become the
                brick and cement of all the objects in our universe that exists now.
            </p>
            <p>This difference in symmetry occurred 0.00000000000000000000000000000000001 s after the birth. This led to
                a process known as inflation.
            </p>
            <p>Due to the consequence of breaking fundamental symmetries, the dominant force became the zero-point
                energy( basically the vibrational energy the atoms still possess even at 0°K) of a quantum field.
            </p>
            <p>You know the speed of light, it's 299792458 m/s. The speed of light abbreviated as c is fundamentally the
                fastest thing possible. But inflation was faster and still didn't violate Einstein's relativity!
            </p>
            <p>Because when inflation occurred the universe itself expanded, creating time and space in the process.
                This is not speed in the traditional sense. The context of measuring speed doesn't exist here as the
                very physical laws that we use were being generated as the universe expanded.
            </p>
            <p>In the small-time the inflation continued, the universe doubled in size about 80 times; almost an
                increase of the factor of 10^78.
            </p><br>
            <p>You remember the non-symmetries that made the zero-point energy dominant! This was the very reason for
                the occurrence of inflation, but as the universe expanded those differences in symmetries diluted to an
                almost non- perceivable extent, as a result, we see quite a homogeneous universe now.
            </p>
            <p>As it expanded, albeit, at a much slower rate when inflation ended, it slowly cooled down enough that the
                known physical principles can be applied.
            </p>
            <p>During the initial days, the universe was a cascading soup of myriad particles like photons,
                particle-antiparticle pairs colliding, annihilating, and transforming into one another.
            </p><br>
            <p>*The threshold temperature is the temperature below which particles of a given type are no longer
                produced.
            </p><br>
            <p>Hadron era:- It lasted from 10^-8 to 10^-4 s and most of the building blocks of atomic nuclei, protons,
                and neutrons formed in this era.
            </p><br>
            <p>Threshold temperature: T=10^12K(reached t=10^-4s) Hardons include protons, neutrons, and mesons.
            </p><br>
            <p>Lepton era:- It lasted from 10^-4 s to 1s. Photon energies became large enough to form light particles
                such as electron-positron pairs.
            </p>
            <p>Due to symmetry breakdown, some electrons left over-produced into the present astronomical bodies.
                Neutrino decoupling (stopped interacting) took place.
            </p><br>
            <p>Radiation era:- Lasted from 1s to 1 million years(temperature varies from 10^10K to 40,000°K.
                Electromagnetic radiation started. Within a few hundred seconds helium was produced.
            </p><br>
            <p>Radiation decoupling( Matter era):- 1 million years to the present date
            </p>
            <p>Stars, galaxies, planets, and human life formed. The dark age started after the temperature reached a few
                thousand degrees and remained till the first stars started igniting.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The big bang was calm just like we are when we were young. It gathered non-symmetries skin to how we
                gather the views, and opinions of others. All this is systematically fed into our brains and we are
                programmed to act in a certain way.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>This is where we start fighting ourselves. We forget to acknowledge that it's a part of us before waging
                a war against ourselves. All these changes, non-symmetries, and imperfections are required just as it
                was essential for the existence of matter. Otherwise, we cease to be human!
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>When inflation occurred, the universe almost flattened out all the differences but was still reminded of
                its past through cosmic microwave radiation.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>We can always pave out our blemishes, but never truly forget them!
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>If there's one thing to take away after reading this;-
            </p>
            <p>Go sit out at night, probably on your roof or somewhere where the sky is visible, and look at the stars
                twinkling ( if you can find the Orion constellation). And look at how those differences can produce such
                a magnificence. And you are such a mess, think about what meaning you could create in your and others'
                life!
            </p>
